# Persian RST Corpus

This is the first version of the Persian RST corpus. This corpus currently consists of 150 journalistic texts, annotated in the framework of Rhetorical Structure Theory [1]. The name of each file contains the source of the news; e.g. etemad001.rs3 was taken from Etemad newspaper. More details about each corpus text could be found in the metadata file, where you could also find the source as well as the date, author and link of the article. Corpus files are stored in xml format.  We have annotated the corpus using [rstweb](https://github.com/amir-zeldes/rstWeb) [2] and recommend using it if you want to see RST trees graphically.
